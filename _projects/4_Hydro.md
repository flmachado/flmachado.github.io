title: Emergent Hydrodynamics in isolated quantum systems
description: How does classical hydrodynamics emerge from the isolated unitary quantum dynamics?
---

Classical hydrodynamics provides a generic framework for capturing the motion of conserved quantities (e.g. energy, mass, momentum); it enables a simplified description of dynamical phenomena ranging from the formation of galaxies to the growth of bacteria colonies. Interestingly, conventional lore suggests that the late-time dynamics of quantum systems can also be captured by classical hydrodynamics. Proving this expectation remains an important open problem. More broadly, there exists no generic toolset capable of either predicting the nature of the effective hydrodynamical description or computing the associated transport coefficients.
