title: Spin Liquids and AMO Experiments
description: What kinds of spin liquids are there and how can we study them in the lab?
---

Arising from an interplay between geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations, spin liquids represent a topological phase of matter exhibiting long-range entanglement. The last half century has seen sustained efforts to theoretically characterize and experimentally realize this elusive phase. Probing such phase often relies upon the ability to engineer quantum materials; by controlling the crystal structure, composition, and substrate, the strength and type of interactions can be manipulated. The development of well-isolated, highly coherent many-body quantum platforms offers a complementary approach. The precise, local, and time-dependent control of the microscopic parameters in these platforms offers a tantalizing opportunity to control and engineed quantum matter one particle at a time.
