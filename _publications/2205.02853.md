 Although the Bethe ansatz solution of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model dates back nearly a century, the anomalous nature of its high-temperature transport dynamics has only recently been uncovered. Indeed, numerical and experimental observations have demonstrated that spin transport in this paradigmatic model falls into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. This has inspired the significantly stronger conjecture that KPZ dynamics, in fact, occur in all integrable spin chains with non-Abelian symmetry. Here, we provide extensive numerical evidence affirming this conjecture. Moreover, we observe that KPZ transport is even more generic, arising in both supersymmetric and periodically-driven models. Motivated by recent advances in the realization of SU(N)-symmetric spin models in alkaline-earth-based optical lattice experiments, we propose and analyze a protocol to directly investigate the KPZ scaling function in such systems.
