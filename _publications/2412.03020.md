Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a promising application of distributed quantum systems, where a client can perform computations on a remote server without revealing any details of the applied circuit. While the most promising realizations of quantum computers are based on various matter qubit platforms, implementing BQC on matter qubits remains an outstanding challenge. Using silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in nanophotonic diamond cavities with an efficient optical interface, we experimentally demonstrate a universal quantum gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit blind gates over a distributed two-node network. Using these ingredients, we perform a distributed algorithm with blind operations across our two-node network, paving the way towards blind quantum computation with matter qubits in distributed, modular architectures.
